Use case considerations: ![Alt](https://github.com/rkastilani/PowerOutagePredictor/blob/master/Graphs/usecase.png)

Here is the design for the final GUI: ![Alt](https://github.com/rkastilani/PowerOutagePredictor/blob/master/Graphs/GUIDesign.png)

Input Data: 
	day length hours
	temperature: max, mean, min
	humidity: max, mean, min
	visibility miles: max, mean, min
	wind speed: max, mean
	max gust speed
	precipitation

Output (prediction):
	# of outage(equioment failure and others)
	
Machine Learning methods: LASSO, Tree-based, SVM, and NN.s
