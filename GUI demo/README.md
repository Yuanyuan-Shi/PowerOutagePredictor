## GUI

The GUI can display the history of outages and the prediction data generated from any machine learning algorithm that the user preferred in the project. A web-based user interactive interface is built using Javascript. Users could read the prediction and history outages from the dashboard on any mobile device. Since the data is confidential, the outage data demonstration is only available from 2014/03/01 to 2014/03/30, and the information is hashed.

Features:
1. The webpage could refresh daily, so the perdiction results can update daily.
2. Users could select the date range from date picker, they can read the history data from the table.
3. Users could sort ascending or descending by any header of the table.
4. Users could zoom in/out of the Google map, and it will automatically center the map based on the markers.
5. Once users click markers, it will display infomation window that provides detailed outages data.
6. Users could easily read the distribution of the outages
7. Users could study any date range they want.
8. It is mobile device friendly. The layout will automatically change based on the device.
