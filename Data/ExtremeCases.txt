Lessons leaned from the extreme cases

1. Tons of failures were reported because
	a. trees in wire, mainly accociated with high wind speed (average highest wind speed 35.3 mph, and average maximum wind gust 49.0 mph).
	b. lighitning, mostly accoviated with "thunderstorm" in the "Event" catagory. Need to exam more weather data to see whether it is a sufficient condition.

2. On most of the extreme days, though the majority of the records are catogried as OH, there are on average 2 records of equipment failure (trans + gen) and 1 UG. 

3. One of the days was mostly because of the snow. 

4. May need to separate the days with extreme weather conditions.
