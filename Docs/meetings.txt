Yuanyuan - get weather and put into table
Yanbo - Investigate the special cases where there are tons of failure
Jerry - Equipment failures -> poisson model.
Ryan - normalize daylight time. jan 1 2000 - march 2016

Separate the equipment failures from other causes. Then sum together.

Machine Learning

Yuanyuan - NN, background
Jerry - Regression/LASSO, logistic regression, appeal
Ryan - SVM, drawbacks
