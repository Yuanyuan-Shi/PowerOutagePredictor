# Power Outage Predictor

As the name suggests, Power Outage Predictor is a python package dedicated to predict power outages given certain weather conditions. Although the package can be implemented in any, the package was developed using utilities and weather data in Seattle, WA; hence caution should be made on prediction power outage elsewhere. A GUI implementation of the package is also available, though it is not complete.
