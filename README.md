# Seattle Power Outage

Since we do not plan to commercialize this, this project is under the permissive MIT license. If anything changes, we will be sure to update accordingly.

* Predict the number of power outage daily. (e.g. 70% chance of having 6-10 outages) 
* Predict the failure type. (e.g. equipment-caused or tree/animal-caused failure)
* Use dashboard and heat map to help users to understand the outage history
